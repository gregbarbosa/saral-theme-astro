The best freelancers and agencies in the world always do this.

When I started my freelance journey, I expected everything to be hunky-dory.

A client would ask for a website with a red background, but the red I chose wasn't the right red.

They'd ask for me to change it, then change it back, then use a new color, then back to red.

Then add a small little blue box.

Then the client says, "Oh wait. I want to build a shopping cart. You can do that, right?"

"Well, yes, I can. But I need to charge more for that."

"Why? You've done all these other changes for free…"

ugh…

Welcome to scope creep. The number one thing to avoid when starting as a new freelancer. By managing expectations before a contract is signed, you and your client agree as to what is going to get done, and by when.

Do this well, and your best clients will keep coming back over and over again.

And who wouldn't love that?
